# Git Comits Recomandations

I have noticed that the way we are doing get commits is lacking. I think I have a way of fixing this problem but you can continue doing it however you want.

## 1) Open a New Branch

Having a differnt branch for every team is not working, the branches are never uptodate, and we keep getting sync errors. So instead just create a new branch that is uptodate, and make sure that it works with your team mate before pushing. You could even ask your team mate to do the final push for you after reviewing it.

## 2) Edit Branch

Edit the branch as usaual.

## 3) Commit Branch and Review

Commit your changes, review as noramal, and finally DELETE the branch. This should insure that all branches are uptodate at all times.

## Note

These are suggestions you don't need  to follow them.
